  <article>
      <p>Hi there! Nice to meet you all. I guess you're wondering who that tall,
      bearded classmate of yours is. Well, let me try to answer that question.
      Let's go!</p>

       <p>My name is Guillermo Sáez Gómez. I am originally from <span title='Oh, like "La belle de Cadix"? Yes, exactly!'><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1diz">Cadis</a></span>, a small
       town located in the very south of Spain. I arrived in Belgium on Erasmus
        in 2015 and, like many others, never left. Came for the university, stayed for
   the <del>beer</del> people.</p>

   <h2>Computer science graduate?</h2>
     <p>Oh, no, no. Nothing like that, actually. In fact, my educational background
     has very little to do with software development. Okay, maybe a little.</p>
     <p>I actually studied translation and conference interpreting, and music.
     In fact, came to Brussels to study at the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles.
     Then I finished my studies, and started working as a translator and conference
     interpreter.</p>

     <p>During lockdown, I started toying around the idea of a career change. I thought
     of a few possibilities, including software development, looked up some information
     about each one of them and... Facebook did the rest. God bless those algorithms!
    </p>
  <h2>Last ten years</h2>
    <p>Okay, so basically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2011: Started studying translation and interpreting in Seville</li>
      <li>2012: Started studying music, also in Seville</li>

    </ul>
